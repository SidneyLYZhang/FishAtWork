Of couse, Python is prerequisite. You can get it in these following ways:

- Linux: `sudo xxxxxx install python3` . "xxxxxx" is your Package Manager of your linux, for exsample `dnf` for Fedora .
- Windows: download from [Python Releases for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

After having Python, you can install this script. 

```bash

```

Then you will be able to use this Script in CLI with python.
